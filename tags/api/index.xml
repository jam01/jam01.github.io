In fact, during our time at MS3, my friend Josh Erney (the DataWeave guru) and I collaborated to clarify what an API-Led implementation should look like.

If you&amp;rsquo;ve worked with me in the past, you know that API-Led is not anywhere near the top of my go-to patterns, to put it politely.
I&amp;rsquo;ll usually engage honestly in a discussion around the applicability and limitations of the pattern based on my experience and that of other thought leaders in this space.</description></item></channel></rss>
