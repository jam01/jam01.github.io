It is a badly kept secret that the most challenging aspect of developing Software is not writing the code, but drafting accurate **specification, design, and testing** of the code.

Because of these challenges, **companies that want to offer compelling and modern digital services need to make strategic decisions on where to Buy vs Build their Software**. Companies that choose Off The Shelf solutions wisely circumvent those challenges where there's little value, and can focus their effort on more valuable and differentiating assets. Then they are left _only_ with the exercise of filling in the gaps between components bought and built in-house.

The surface area of these integration components may be smaller, but the challenges and opportunities for differentiating value are still significant!


# Enterprise Integration Craftsmanship

Counting with years of in depth experience designing and implementing Enterprise Integration solutions, from healthcare to banking, from Fortune 500 companies to public universities; Jose can **guide your company's integration needs** from discovery to implementation, and ultimately to the delivery of **valuable customer outcomes**.

Solutions can be crafted in a few different configurations:

Using the **Mule Runtime** deployed on Anypoint's Cloudhub or Runtime Fabric, or even in plain VMs or any containerized environment. Or alternatively using more flexible, performant, and entirely free and Open Source frameworks: **Apache Camel and DataSonnet**. These can be deployed in plain VMs or any containerized environment such as Amazon's ECS, Kubernetes, or Openshift.

So, after Buy vs Build, what else can an organization do in order to maximize productivity of their Software teams? The answer is **requirements refining and rapid prototyping**, and **growing software** (not building) â€” and that's where Cloud Native Development, and Agile and Continuous Delivery practices come in!

# Cloud Native Applications

[See What is Cloud-Native?](https://stackify.com/cloud-native/)

Effectively with cloud native we maximize utilization, scalability, and reusability by using a microservices architectural style while leveraging Linux containers and, perhaps most importantly, the growing list of open source software that help manage the many challenges that microservices and containers present: management, orchestration, observability, security, governance, to name a few.

According to [Red Hat's 2021 State of Enterprise Open Source Report](https://www.redhat.com/en/enterprise-open-source-report/2021), of the 1,250 IT leaders surveyed:

* 85% agree that Kubernetes is key to cloud-native application strategies
* 79% expect their use of enterprise open source software for emerging technologies to increase over the next two years

With an in-depth understanding and years of professional experience in the cloud native and open source landscape, Jose can guide your company from infrastructure through delivery all the way to observability and governance to **deliver an innovative cloud native platform strategy** tailored to your needs.


# Agile and Continuous Delivery

According to Jez Humble's _Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations_, continuous delivery practices such as continuous integration, deployment automation, test automation, trunk-based development, and working in small batches predict IT performance. From those surveyed regarding the use of these practices:

 * High performers reported spending 49% of their time on new work and 21% on unplanned work or rework.
 * In contrast, low performers spend 38% of their time on new work and 27% on unplanned work or rework.

Counting with an in-depth knowledge of Continuous Delivery practices in a cloud native environment and as an agile practitioner and certified Scrum Master, Jose can help your teams **grow your software deliverables incrementally and iteratively**, all by adhering to **best practices around Continuous Integration and Delivery** (CI/CD).
